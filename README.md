# minishell

Really simple shell based of an Epitech first year project.

## Goals

I Just wanted to have some fun with C like before, so I just made this really
simple project. It is still being made but I will continue working on it (Or not
I really don't know xd).

## For Epitech students

Don't just copy the code here without understanding, go first to a man page
before anything else :), else the -42 is coming.

## Specifications

It tries to stay as close as possible to Epitech's C code norm, but I will break
it if there are times that I feel would make code better to read/write.
